# Solar Fusion Reactions Analysis

This Python package performs analysis of nuclear reactions that are important for Solar Fusion, in particular, the associated S-factors.  The package enables the user to utilize (or add) various models for the S-factors and then will perform a Bayesian analysis of the models with the data.  The package will then perform a Bayes Model Averaging of the models utilizing the Bayes Factor as the relative weight of a model given the data.



### Installation
This package can be locally installed with three steps
```
git clone https://github.com/walkloud/solar_fusion_reactions
cd solar_fusion_reactions
pip install -e .
```
which should install the executable `fit_sf_reactions`.
