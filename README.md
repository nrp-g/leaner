# Low Energy Analysis of NuclEar Reactions (LEANER)

This Python package performs analysis of low-energy nuclear reactions, many of which are important for Solar Fusion, in particular, the associated S-factors.  The package enables the user to utilize (or add) various models for the S-factors and then will perform a Bayesian analysis of the models with the data.  The package will then perform a Bayes Model Averaging of the models utilizing the Bayes Factor as the relative weight of a model given the data.  The analysis closely follows that in Moscoso et al [arXiv:2109.00049](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00049), adding to that the Bayes Model Averaging.

Currently supported reactions
- $D(p,\gamma)^3{\rm He}$ -- aka $S_{12}$

### Installation
This package can be locally installed with three steps
```
git clone https://github.com/nrp-g/leaner
cd leaner
pip install -e .
```
which should install the executable `leaner`.

#### Reinstalling
Reinstalling the package after updates is as simple as (from the leaner directory)
```
git pull
pip install -e .
```

#### Uninstalling
To uninstall the package
```
pip uninstall leaner
```

#### Testing
Test it out in a clean environment.  If you have the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) Python package manager installed, you can create a new env and install
```
conda create -n bare3.8 python=3.8 numpy scipy
conda activate bare3.8
pip install -e .
```
- NOTE 1: On my new M2 mac, with a new homebrew, homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew` rather than `/usr/local`.  Therefore, in order to get `pip` to find the HDF5 installation (after `brew install hdf5`), I need to add `export HDF5_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5` to my `.bash_profile`, otherwise, `pip install tables` fails.

- NOTE 2: The installation will claim to have failed, but this is a known issue with required packages described in the `setup.cfg` file and `setuptools`, not being able to find packages that where just installed as a dependency.  A test of whether it worked or not is to type

```which leaner```

If that returns a location, the installation should have worked.  This can be more thoroughly tested by running the help command

```leaner -h```

which returns the [usage](#usage) message.



### Usage
The analysis package uses an input file where the user specifies information such as the data file and priors for the parameters.  In addition, many options for turning on and off various options (such as adding unknown extrinsic uncertainties, the log-normal normalization factors, which models to use etc.) can be controlled at run time with the command line.  For example

```
$ leaner -h
usage: leaner [-h] [--SF_reaction SF_REACTION] [--fit_params FIT_PARAMS]
                   [--d_file D_FILE] [--d_sets D_SETS [D_SETS ...]]
